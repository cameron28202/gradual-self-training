## Overview

Self-training is a type of semi-supervised learning where a model is trained with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The idea is to iteratively improve the model by using its own predictions to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data.

In this project, we explore various self-training techniques and their effectiveness on different datasets.
